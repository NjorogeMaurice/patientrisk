### ART Discontinuation Likelihood Predictor

The ART Discontinuation Likelihood Predictor is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV patients. By analyzing various patient factors and treatment-related variables, this predictor aims to provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights into the probability of a patient discontinuing their ART regimen.

### Features:

* **Predictive Model:** Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of ART discontinuation based on patient data.
* **Input Variables:** Incorporates a range of input variables such as patient demographics, treatment history, viral load, CD4 count, adherence patterns, and comorbidities.
* **Scalable**: The predictor is designed to handle large datasets and can be scaled for use in healthcare systems of varying sizes.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Offers a simple and intuitive interface for inputting patient data and obtaining discontinuation likelihood predictions.
* **Interpretability:** Provides insights into the factors contributing to the predicted likelihood of ART discontinuation, aiding clinicians in understanding and addressing patient-specific risk factors.

### Usage:

* **Input Patient Data:** Enter relevant patient information into the predictor, including demographics, clinical history, and treatment details.
* **Generate Prediction**: Click the "Predict" button to generate a likelihood score indicating the probability of ART discontinuation for the given patient.
* **Review Insights:** Explore the provided insights and factors contributing to the predicted discontinuation likelihood to inform clinical decision-making and patient management.
